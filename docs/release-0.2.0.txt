Libcrossmark 0.2 released
=========================

Libcrossmark 0.2 /Placeholder for release name/ has been released on 
Jan, 8. 2007.

Libcrossmark is a library for handling the emerging crossmark[1] 
document format, a simple, wiki-inspired text format that lends itself 
very well for the creation of text documents or elaborate emails. 
Apart from that the crossmark document format will be used by the One 
Laptop per Child[2] project.

This early preview release is supporting only a limited subset of the 
currently specified standard (draft version 4), namely paragraph, 
blockquote and heading blocks, as well as styling. It is made 
available to start discussion about the libcrossmark public API. 
For more information have a look at the README[3] and HACKING[4] files 
or documentation generated at build (requires doxygen[5]). Please note 
that this development snapshot is using asserts (specifically calls to 
g_assert() of the glib[6] library) liberally, and therefore can tear 
down a consumer application in case of error.

Special thanks goes out to Dom Lachowicz for his assistance in 
creating python bindings.

Credits for the 0.1 version that was not announced publicly go to 

# Marc Maurer: svn setup, portable build system, initial API review. 

# Fridrich Strba: architecture review, advanced C++ tips.
