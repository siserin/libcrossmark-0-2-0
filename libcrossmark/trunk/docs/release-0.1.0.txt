Libcrossmark 0.1 released
=========================

Libcrossmark 0.1 /Four style one break/ has been released on 
Dec, 14. 2006. 

Libcrossmark is an effort to implement a library for handling the 
emerging crossmark document format. The crossmark format is a simple, 
wiki-inspired text format that lends itself very well for the creation 
of text documents or elaborate emails. Apart from that it is also used 
in the Laptop.org[2] educational revolution.

This early preview release, supporting only a limited subset of the 
currently specified standard draft version 4 is intended to start 
discussion about public API and internal architecture.

Thanks goes out to all AbiWord[3] developers who assisted in the 
effort, in particular
# Marc Maurer: svn setup, portable build system, initial API review.
# Fridrich Strba: architecture review, advanced C++ tips.
