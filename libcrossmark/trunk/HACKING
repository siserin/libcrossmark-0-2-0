HACKING
=======

Coding Style
------------

Indentation/spacing: We indent with tabs. Not spaces. For the rest: 
just look at the code around you, and copy that :)

While 80 character wide terminals are hardly used nowadays we are 
still restricting lines of code to not be any wider. This prevents 
deep nesting of constructs.

Documentation
-------------

Source code and interfaces are documented using Doxygen. Usually one 
short paragraph per method should be enough, except you are doing 
seriously fancy stuff. Build with --enable-internal-docs to have all
documentation included in the doxygen output (written to 
docs/doxygen/html).

Auxiliary documentation, like this very file for example, are 
written in crossmark markup. Do not exceed a line-length of 72 
characters.
