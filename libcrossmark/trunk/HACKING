HACKING

Coding Style
------------

Indentation/spacing: We indent with tabs. Not spaces. For the rest: 
just look at the code around you, and copy that :)

While 80 character wide terminals are hardly used nowadays we are 
still restricting lines of code to not be any wider. This prevents 
deep nesting of constructs.

Documentation
-------------

Source code and interfaces are documented using Doxygen. Usually one 
short paragraph per method should be enough, except you are doing 
seriously fancy stuff.

Auxiliary documentation, like this very document for example, are 
written in crossmark markup. Do not exceed a line-length of 72 
characters.
