README
======

Libcrossmark is a library for working with documents in crossmark 
syntax, see [1] for more info. More info about libcrossmark itself
can be found at [2].

Please note that libcrossmark is currently not ready for being used in
multi-threaded applications, in particular when multiple threads are 
reading documents at the same time. Should be easily fixable, though.

Warning
-------

This software is in early prototype stadium. Releases are only made 
to gather feedback from interested developers. Section 15. of the 
COPYING file distributed with this package provides a more elaborate 
disclaimer.
